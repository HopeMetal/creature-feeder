Creature Feeder

For Ludum Dare 41

My idea was Horror + Pet Game. I don't know how to make either. :)

I used the LÃ–VE framework: https://love2d.org/ and Lua: http://www.lua.org/ to create the game
Graphics were made in Paint.NET and Inkscape
Sounds were edited in Audacity
The font used is DejaVu Sans

STORY:
You have been thrown into a dungeon with a hungry creature to be its caretaker.
You must now feed and play with it.
If you fail you will be eaten.
"Good Luck"

How To Play:
Press the buttons on the screen with your mouse to feed or play with the creature
In ball mode, drag your mouse and release to throw the ball
In feed mode, drag the food onto the creature to feed it
Press ESC to exit the game
Everything else is explained in the game itself

How To Run:

ON WINDOWS:
1. Download the repository from GitHub and run "feeder.exe" located in the folder "win"

ON MAC OS X AND LINUX:
1. Download the repo then read this: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started
2. Use the file "main.love"

HAVE FUN! (or not)
